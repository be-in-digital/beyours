### Minor Changes

- bd7a656: Wire up dine-in table numbers, and make the four allergen surfaces agree

  Two product surfaces were designed, translated, and never connected.

  ## A dine-in order now carries the table it is served to

  "Sur place" was offered in the order-type selector and accepted by
  `orders.create`, and nothing anywhere carried a table number — zero occurrences
  in `tables/orders.ts`, `tables/kitchen.ts`, the storefront, the kitchen
  components or the order functions. The printed slip gave a cook the dish and
  the customer's name, so staff had a plate and nowhere to take it. One of the
  three advertised order types was unusable. The tell was `checkout.tableNumber`:
  shipped and translated into `fr`, `en` and `es`, and read by no code at all.

  `orders.tableNumber` and `kitchenTickets.tableNumber` are new
  `v.optional(v.string())` columns. `orders.create` accepts a table, normalises
  it, and `releaseToKitchen` copies it onto every ticket the order produces; the
  slip prints `TABLE <n>` at the same size as the order number, and the kitchen
  display card shows it beside the order number.

  It is a **label**, not a number — dining rooms use `A3` and `Terrasse 4` as
  readily as `12`, and parsing the field as an integer would reject half of them.

  It deliberately does **not** share a foreign key with `gameQRCodes.tableNumber`,
  which names the same real-world thing. There is no `tables` table, and adding
  one would make dine-in service depend on the gamification QR codes being
  configured — a restaurant can serve _sur place_ without ever running the wheel
  of fortune. The two share a representation instead:
  `@be-in-digital/core/dining` normalises and bounds a table label for both.

  Required at the storefront, optional on the server. Uber Eats and Deliveroo
  forward `dine_in` orders that carry no table of their own, and refusing those
  would lose the order outright. A table number on a `delivery` or `pickup` order
  is rejected, which catches the order whose type was switched after the table
  was typed.

  While wiring it, the checkout form turned out to carry its **own** two-option
  fulfilment toggle that knew nothing about the store's services: a cart set to
  `dine_in` showed "À emporter" selected, and one click silently rewrote the type
  to `pickup`. The customer sat at a table and the kitchen was told to bag the
  order. The toggle now offers the same three types the cart does, filtered by
  the same predicate the server validates against, and selects exactly.

  ## One allergen vocabulary instead of four

  The chain was broken at every link, and each surface had drifted because each
  carried its own idea of what an allergen was:
  - the printed kitchen ticket rendered `{allergens.join(", ")}` — whatever text
    was in the array is what a cook read before plating;
  - the admin product form had **no allergen control at all**, only a zod field
    and a `[]` default, so a restaurateur could not declare one through the
    normal product editor;
  - the only production writer was therefore the AI image-to-product flow, whose
    prompt is written in French, feeding an unvalidated comma-separated text box;
  - `uberEatsMenuSync` declared `allergens?: string[]` and never mapped it, so
    every dish synced to Uber Eats went out with no allergen declaration.

  For an EU food business under INCO 1169/2011 that is a regulatory surface.

  `@be-in-digital/core/allergens` is now the single source of truth: the
  fourteen Annex II allergens plus `shellfish` and the two dietary markers, the
  alias table that matches French and English spellings through accents,
  ligatures and punctuation, the localised labels, and the Uber Eats mapping.
  It is framework-free and exported as raw source, so the design system, both
  apps, the admin package and the Convex runtime can all consult it.

  The representation decision, made once and applied everywhere: **allergens stay
  free text** — refusing a name we do not know would push a real declaration off
  the menu — **but every surface resolves through this vocabulary, and a value it
  does not recognise is treated explicitly as unverified rather than passed off
  as checked.**

  So: the badge renders it as the owner typed it and announces it as the
  restaurant's own wording; the kitchen slip prints it under `MENTIONS À
VÉRIFIER :` rather than folded into the allergen line, because a cook has to
  treat it differently; the admin marks the chip `non vérifiée` and states the
  consequence; and Uber Eats is not sent it at all, since filing an unknown value
  as `OTHER` would show a diner a declaration that names nothing. Those are
  reported to the owner instead of dropped in silence.

  Dietary markers are no longer treated as allergens anywhere: `vegan` printed
  under `ALLERGÈNES :` told a cook it was one.

  `packages/admin` gains one allergen control, shared by the product form (a new
  `Allergènes` tab) and the AI review card, so the two cannot disagree again.

  ### Known limitation

  `UBER_EATS_ALLERGEN_TYPE` maps every canonical key to an Uber Eats enum member,
  but those spellings are **not verified against Uber's live menu schema** —
  `developer.uber.com` is unreachable from CI and Uber does not publish the enum
  outside the partner portal. The mapping is total and typed, so correcting it is
  a one-table change that every caller inherits. Confirm it during Uber Eats
  onboarding; see `tasks/uber-eats-go-live-runbook.md`.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [c9619e2]
- Updated dependencies [bd7a656]
- Updated dependencies [bd17a78]
  - @be-in-digital/core@2.4.0

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8ce83cb: Publish the packages whose source has been ahead of the registry since July,
  and fix the one thing that kept a client site from compiling even then.

  `@be-in-digital/integrations`, `@be-in-digital/marketing` and `@be-in-digital/ui`
  all still sit at **2.0.2 on GitHub Packages**, and all three have had source
  changes merged since — without a version bump. `changeset publish` then answers
  `already published` and skips them, so the registry keeps serving the July
  build under a version number the repository has since changed. Published 2.0.2
  and workspace 2.0.2 are two different sets of code.

  Nothing catches it in this repository, because `apps/themes` links these
  packages with `workspace:^` and compiles against the current source. Only a real
  client site installs the published artefact — and `beyours-boilerplate` has been
  failing its type-check since 2026-08-16 for exactly this reason:

  ```
  convex/emailCampaignActions.ts:136  Expected 2-3 arguments, but got 4
  convex/uberDirect.ts:387            Property 'uberDirect' does not exist on ...
  ```

  What each package has been withholding:
  - **`integrations`** — the whole **Uber Direct** module (`#66`: book, track and
    cancel a courier, ~950 lines under `src/uber-direct/`) is exported from
    `src/index.ts` and absent from the published bundle. A feature the fleet has
    never received.
  - **`marketing`** — `renderTemplateToEmailHtml` gained a fourth `options`
    argument and `absolutiseUrls` became public (`#185`). Without them, a campaign
    email built by a client site renders `/api/files/…` paths that resolve to
    nothing inside an inbox, and the call site does not compile.
  - **`ui`** — the storefront fix that keeps `draft` establishments out of the
    public site (`#116`), plus accessibility repairs: `Switch` announces itself as
    a switch rather than a checkbox, `Card` carries the `data-slot` every other
    primitive has, `AddressAutocomplete` labels its fields, and `Dialog` stops
    overflowing the viewport.

  **`admin` carries one real fix.** It ships raw TypeScript (`files: ["src"]`,
  every `exports` entry pointing at a `.ts`), so a consumer type-checks its source
  — and `@types/qrcode` sat in `devDependencies`, where an installing client never
  sees it. `qr-codes-page.tsx` therefore failed to compile in every client site
  while compiling fine here, because `apps/reference` happens to declare those
  types itself. For a package that ships source, an `@types/*` backing a runtime
  dependency is part of the public type surface: moved to `dependencies`.
  `@types/react` stays in `devDependencies` — React is a peer dependency and the
  consumer brings its own.

  Otherwise no source changes — only the versions the registry should have been
  serving.

  Verified against a real `beyours-boilerplate` clone with these four packages
  built from this branch and installed in place of the published ones: `tsc
--noEmit` goes from four errors to clean.

## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 7f0122b: Republished from main. Fixes two problems with the 2.0.1 tarballs that broke consumers:
  - `@be-in-digital/core`: the `./auth/rbac` subpath pointed at `src/auth/rbac.ts` while the tarball only ships `dist/` → broken import for consumers (`convex-functions/auth` included). `files` now includes `src`.
  - The type fixes that were on main but never published (promotion-form/email-config in admin, Uber Eats signatures in integrations/convex-functions) go out with this patch — they had been committed without a changeset.

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 321adad: Production-readiness audit fixes for delivery integrations:
  - **integrations**: the Uber Eats order mapper now keeps money in integer **cents**
    instead of dividing by 100. Previously Uber order totals were stored 100× too
    small while Deliveroo and website orders used cents. `UnifiedOrder` money fields
    are documented as cents.
  - **convex-schema**: add the `oauthStates` table (single-use CSRF `state` for OAuth
    connect flows) and add `uberEatsConnections` to the package's composed reference
    schema so it no longer drifts from the app schema.
  - **convex-functions**: `createFromWebhook` now returns `{ orderId, created }` so
    webhook handlers can skip duplicate kitchen-ticket creation and double
    auto-accept when Uber/Deliveroo retry a delivery (idempotent order import).
