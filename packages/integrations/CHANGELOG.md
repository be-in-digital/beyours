# @be-in-digital/integrations

## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 7f0122b: Republished from main. Fixes two problems with the 2.0.1 tarballs that broke consumers:
  - `@be-in-digital/core`: the `./auth/rbac` subpath pointed at `src/auth/rbac.ts` while the tarball only ships `dist/` → broken import for consumers (`convex-functions/auth` included). `files` now includes `src`.
  - The type fixes that were on main but never published (promotion-form/email-config in admin, Uber Eats signatures in integrations/convex-functions) go out with this patch — they had been committed without a changeset.

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 321adad: Production-readiness audit fixes for delivery integrations:
  - **integrations**: the Uber Eats order mapper now keeps money in integer **cents**
    instead of dividing by 100. Previously Uber order totals were stored 100× too
    small while Deliveroo and website orders used cents. `UnifiedOrder` money fields
    are documented as cents.
  - **convex-schema**: add the `oauthStates` table (single-use CSRF `state` for OAuth
    connect flows) and add `uberEatsConnections` to the package's composed reference
    schema so it no longer drifts from the app schema.
  - **convex-functions**: `createFromWebhook` now returns `{ orderId, created }` so
    webhook handlers can skip duplicate kitchen-ticket creation and double
    auto-accept when Uber/Deliveroo retry a delivery (idempotent order import).
