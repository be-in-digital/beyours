# @be-in-digital/admin

## 7.0.0

### Patch Changes

- 8ce83cb: Publish the packages whose source has been ahead of the registry since July,
  and fix the one thing that kept a client site from compiling even then.

  `@be-in-digital/integrations`, `@be-in-digital/marketing` and `@be-in-digital/ui`
  all still sit at **2.0.2 on GitHub Packages**, and all three have had source
  changes merged since — without a version bump. `changeset publish` then answers
  `already published` and skips them, so the registry keeps serving the July
  build under a version number the repository has since changed. Published 2.0.2
  and workspace 2.0.2 are two different sets of code.

  Nothing catches it in this repository, because `apps/themes` links these
  packages with `workspace:^` and compiles against the current source. Only a real
  client site installs the published artefact — and `beyours-boilerplate` has been
  failing its type-check since 2026-08-16 for exactly this reason:

  ```
  convex/emailCampaignActions.ts:136  Expected 2-3 arguments, but got 4
  convex/uberDirect.ts:387            Property 'uberDirect' does not exist on ...
  ```

  What each package has been withholding:
  - **`integrations`** — the whole **Uber Direct** module (`#66`: book, track and
    cancel a courier, ~950 lines under `src/uber-direct/`) is exported from
    `src/index.ts` and absent from the published bundle. A feature the fleet has
    never received.
  - **`marketing`** — `renderTemplateToEmailHtml` gained a fourth `options`
    argument and `absolutiseUrls` became public (`#185`). Without them, a campaign
    email built by a client site renders `/api/files/…` paths that resolve to
    nothing inside an inbox, and the call site does not compile.
  - **`ui`** — the storefront fix that keeps `draft` establishments out of the
    public site (`#116`), plus accessibility repairs: `Switch` announces itself as
    a switch rather than a checkbox, `Card` carries the `data-slot` every other
    primitive has, `AddressAutocomplete` labels its fields, and `Dialog` stops
    overflowing the viewport.

  **`admin` carries one real fix.** It ships raw TypeScript (`files: ["src"]`,
  every `exports` entry pointing at a `.ts`), so a consumer type-checks its source
  — and `@types/qrcode` sat in `devDependencies`, where an installing client never
  sees it. `qr-codes-page.tsx` therefore failed to compile in every client site
  while compiling fine here, because `apps/reference` happens to declare those
  types itself. For a package that ships source, an `@types/*` backing a runtime
  dependency is part of the public type surface: moved to `dependencies`.
  `@types/react` stays in `devDependencies` — React is a peer dependency and the
  consumer brings its own.

  Otherwise no source changes — only the versions the registry should have been
  serving.

  Verified against a real `beyours-boilerplate` clone with these four packages
  built from this branch and installed in place of the published ones: `tsc
--noEmit` goes from four errors to clean.

### Minor Changes

- 285b579: Record establishment changes in the system audit log

  `systemAuditLog` was only ever written by system operations, so a restaurant
  could be created, renamed, moved, reconfigured or deleted and the journal stayed
  empty. Every mutation in the stores module now appends an entry naming the
  actor, the establishment, the operation, the timestamp and the before/after of
  the fields the edit moved.
  - `systemAuditLog` gains `store_created` / `store_updated` / `store_deleted`,
    an optional `targetStoreId`, and an index to read one establishment's history.
  - The printer API key is redacted on both sides of a `printConfig` diff, and
    create/delete snapshots use a field allowlist so the legacy `integrations`
    blob never reaches the log.
  - `system.getAuditLog` scopes establishment entries to the stores the reader has
    access to, and pages with Convex's own cursor instead of arithmetic that
    stalled after the second page.

## 3.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 5eec48d: Maintenance & migration system: a per-deployment maintenance contract (derived status, update coverage keyed on release date), a release catalog synced from npm that locks published versions once the contract expires, site migration requests (controlled-transition workflow plus audit log), self-serve renewal through Stripe (the `bidProduct: maintenance` webhook creates a contract, never ownerEntitlements), and SES notifications when a request is opened. Adds a Maintenance tab to the admin System page.

### Patch Changes

- 83f6af9: Enforce the order status machine in `updateStatus`.

  The mutation wrote whatever status it was handed. Nothing stopped an order going from `pending` straight to `completed`, or a cancelled order being revived — the transition table existed but only the storefront services consulted it, as advice.

  Three layers each carried their own opinion and they had drifted. The admin UI offered "Envoyer en livraison" on a ready order while the services table forbade `ready -> out_for_delivery`. The table is now single and lives in `@be-in-digital/convex-schema` (`ORDER_STATUS_TRANSITIONS`, `canTransitionOrderStatus`, `getNextOrderStatuses`); the services and the mutation both read it, and `ready -> out_for_delivery` is allowed, matching the button that already existed.

  **Behaviour change:** `updateStatus` now throws `Invalid order status transition: <from> -> <to>` instead of writing. Replaying the current status is an idempotent no-op rather than an error, so webhook retries and double-clicked buttons stay harmless. `updateFromWebhook` is deliberately left unguarded — Uber Eats and Deliveroo are authoritative for the orders they own.

  The cancellation window stops at `confirmed`, matching what Deliveroo permits: an order already being prepared, ready, or with a rider can no longer be cancelled internally.

## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 7f0122b: Republished from main. Fixes two problems with the 2.0.1 tarballs that broke consumers:
  - `@be-in-digital/core`: the `./auth/rbac` subpath pointed at `src/auth/rbac.ts` while the tarball only ships `dist/` → broken import for consumers (`convex-functions/auth` included). `files` now includes `src`.
  - The type fixes that were on main but never published (promotion-form/email-config in admin, Uber Eats signatures in integrations/convex-functions) go out with this patch — they had been committed without a changeset.
