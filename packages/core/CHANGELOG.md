# @be-in-digital/core

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 3a25d85: The environment fail-fast now validates what a deployment cannot run without.

  Every one of the 28 `siteEnvSchema` fields was optional, and `opt()` mapped `''`
  to `undefined` — so a `.env.example` copied and left unfilled validated clean.
  The site booted printing "All environment variables validated successfully" and
  then failed at the restaurant one feature at a time: Stripe not configured, no
  encryption key, no S3 bucket, password reset silently returning early.

  `siteEnvSchema` splits into three:
  - `siteEnvRequiredSchema` — the seven a deployment cannot boot without
    (`NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`, `CONVEX_SITE_URL`, `SITE_URL`, `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
    now at least 32 characters, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME`,
    `AWS_SES_FROM_EMAIL`). Declared without `opt()`, so
    an empty value fails exactly like a missing one.
  - `siteEnvOptionalSchema` — the rest, refined by `SITE_FEATURE_GROUPS`:
    set one variable of Stripe, PayPal, SumUp or BeYours billing and the whole
    group becomes required. Half a payment provider fails at the till, not at boot.
  - `siteEnvSchema` — a deliberately lenient reader, unchanged in behaviour, and
    still what `getSiteEnv()` parses. It runs inside Convex actions holding only a
    subset of the variables, so tightening it would turn a configuration problem
    into a failed customer order.

  Thirteen variables the runtime reads were absent from every schema and are now
  declared, `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` and `BID_APP_URL`
  among them.

  `validateAllEnv()` reports each problem under `'package' | 'site' | 'feature'`
  and names an unset variable as unset rather than as a type error.

- 7e727ff: Serve every folder the product uploads to

  The bucket is private and `/api/files` is the only read path, so the proxy's
  allowlist decides whether an uploaded object is reachable at all. That allowlist
  derived from `ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES` (6 folders) while `convex/storageUpload.ts`
  accepted 10. Uploads to `categories`, `blogs`, `blog-auto`, `storefront` and
  `avatars` therefore succeeded, stored a `/api/files/<key>` URL, and that URL
  returned 404 — the object was written and then unreachable. Category images in
  the admin were the visible case.
  - New `@be-in-digital/core/aws/folders` holds `S3_FOLDERS` and
    `isKnownS3Folder`. Like `aws/media-url`, it has no imports, so Convex actions
    can use it without pulling the package into their bundle.
  - `S3Folder` now covers all eleven folders, and `ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES` and
    `MAX_FILE_SIZES` describe each one. `/api/files` picks the additions up
    automatically, since it derives `SERVABLE_FOLDERS` from that table.
  - `convex/storageUpload.ts` and `/api/upload` derive their allowlists from the
    shared list instead of restating it, so the three cannot drift apart again.
    `/api/upload` previously rejected `email` and `categories` outright.

## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 7f0122b: Republished from main. Fixes two problems with the 2.0.1 tarballs that broke consumers:
  - `@be-in-digital/core`: the `./auth/rbac` subpath pointed at `src/auth/rbac.ts` while the tarball only ships `dist/` → broken import for consumers (`convex-functions/auth` included). `files` now includes `src`.
  - The type fixes that were on main but never published (promotion-form/email-config in admin, Uber Eats signatures in integrations/convex-functions) go out with this patch — they had been committed without a changeset.

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 1a5ca27: Rename package scope from @beindigital-engine to @be-in-digital for GitHub Packages compatibility

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 7c3d4da: Configure private npm publishing for all @beindigital-engine packages

  ### What changed
  - Packages are now publishable to npm as private (restricted) packages under the `@beindigital-engine` scope.
  - Removed `"private": true` flag from all packages and replaced with `"publishConfig": { "access": "restricted" }`.
  - Added `"files"` field to control published contents.

  ### Why

  First official release of all packages on the npm private registry for distribution.
