### Major Changes

- 60dbd7d: Let a refused diner read why, and make three checkout guards able to hold

  `orders.create` is sound: it recomputes every price server-side, dedupes on an
  idempotency key, validates availability, options, quantity and scheduling,
  enforces the minimum order and the delivery radius, and gates on the store's
  service switches. What was left is that its refusals could not be read, and that
  three of its guards could never fire.

  **Every checkout refusal reached the diner as "Server Error".** Convex redacts
  the message of a thrown `Error` in production; only `ConvexError` carries its
  `data` to the browser. The repository states the rule itself, at
  `packages/convex-functions/src/auth.ts:45` and again in
  `invitation-acceptance.test.ts` — and the fix had been applied to the
  **authorization** path and never to the customer checkout path:

  ```
  $ grep -c 'throw new LineRejectedError' packages/convex-functions/src/orderLine.ts   -> 8
  $ grep -c 'throw new Error('            packages/convex-functions/src/orders.ts     -> 15
  $ grep -c ConvexError packages/convex-functions/src/orders.ts                       -> 0
  ```

  So eight carefully written French sentences — `« Pizza » est épuisé.`,
  `« Pizza » exige un choix : Taille.`, the minimum order, the delivery radius, a
  service the restaurant does not run — all became two English words at the moment
  of payment. The diner was blocked with no reason and no action, and abandoned.
  It made the whole server-side validation effort invisible.

  New `RefusalError` (`packages/convex-functions/src/refusal.ts`) extends
  `ConvexError<{ code, message, … }>` — the flat payload `auth.ts` established and
  `lib/convex-error.ts` already reads in both apps. `LineRejectedError`,
  `OrderZoneRejectedError`, `QuoteRejectedError`, `PromotionRejectedError`,
  `FieldTooLongError` and `RateLimitedError` extend it, so every existing throw
  site and every `instanceof` catch is unchanged and the payload now survives the
  wire. `ConvexError` overwrites `message` with the JSON of `data`; the base
  restores the sentence, because a good deal of the storefront and of the suite
  reads `error.message`. Ten plain throws in `orders.ts` became a new
  `OrderRefusedError`, and the checkout page reads `convexErrorMessage(error, …)`
  instead of `error.message`.

  Three of those messages were in **English** — "This store is not open for
  orders", "This store is not accepting orders right now", "This store does not
  offer delivery orders" — the only English copy a diner could be shown on this
  path. They are French now, like the rest of the storefront.

  **Tracked stock was never decremented by an order.**

  ```
  PROBE: stock before = {"tracked":true,"quantity":2}
  PROBE: order 1 -> stock {"tracked":true,"quantity":2}
  PROBE: order 2 -> stock {"tracked":true,"quantity":2}
  PROBE: 4 portions sold out of a tracked stock of 2
  ```

  The `insufficient_stock` guard and its message are correct, and could only ever
  fire if the owner retyped the quantity in the dashboard after every single
  order. A restaurant tracking ten portions of the daily special sold fifty and
  found out in the kitchen. `autoDisableWhenEmpty` hung off the same manual
  `updateStock` mutation, so a dish that ran out never came off the menu on its
  own either.

  `orders.create` now sells the stock the order takes, in the same mutation as the
  order and its kitchen ticket — one transaction, so two checkouts racing for the
  last portion are serialised by the same read-write conflict that protects the
  promotion counter. The auto-disable rule moved out of `updateStock`'s handler
  into a pure `stockPatch`, shared by both callers. A basket is counted as a
  basket: two lines of the same dish were each checked against the stored
  quantity, so a stock of 3 accepted 2 + 2.

  **Opening hours were enforced in the browser only.**

  ```
  PROBE: every day marked isClosed -> order created
  PROBE: 04:00 order accepted (hours 11:00-14:00)
  ```

  `isOrderableStore` returns `store?.status === "open"` and its own comment
  concedes that hours are "a separate question, answered in the storefront".
  Nothing flips `status` on a schedule — there is no such cron — so the weekly week
  the dashboard writes was honoured by exactly one thing: a `toast.error` on the
  checkout page. A tab left open past closing, a cart restored from localStorage
  or a direct call produced a paid order and a kitchen ticket at 4 a.m. in an
  empty building. The hole had been closed one level up for the manual `closed`
  status and left open for the weekly schedule, which is the one restaurants
  actually rely on.

  New `isWithinBusinessHours` and `resolveStoreHours` in
  `@be-in-digital/convex-schema` — the only package `convex-functions` and
  `restaurant` can both import, which is why `storeStatus` and `storeServices` are
  there already. `orders.create` refuses an order outside the resolved week, on the
  establishment's clock and honouring `useGlobalHours`; `isStoreOpen` and
  `useStoreStatus` delegate their boolean to the same function, so the button the
  storefront disables and the order the mutation refuses cannot drift apart. An
  empty week is not a closure — `stores.create` seeds a full one, so an empty array
  means nobody declared anything, and `status` decides as it always has.

  **The menu and the order mutation disagreed about scheduling windows.**

  ```
  PROBE @23:00  client(menu) = false  server(order) = true
  PROBE @01:00  client(menu) = false  server(order) = true
  PROBE tz      client = true (UTC)   server = false (Europe/Paris)
  ```

  The server handled midnight-crossing windows and took a timezone;
  `isProductScheduledNow` did neither — `now.getDay()` / `now.getHours()` on the
  visitor's own clock, and `currentTime > availableUntil` reading a 22:00→02:00
  late menu as an empty set. Two opposite failures out of one seam: the late menu
  was greyed out for every hour it was actually served, and a diner in another
  timezone saw a dish, added it, and was refused at payment — with the unreadable
  error above. `timeWindow` moved to `@be-in-digital/convex-schema` and
  `isProductScheduledNow` renders from it; `isProductAvailable`, the product card,
  the grid, the menu and the favourites grid all take the establishment's
  timezone, which `useStoreStatus` now returns.

  **`/cart` showed "Votre Box est vide" before the persisted cart hydrated.**
  `useCartHydrated` exists for exactly this and documents the failure mode; it had
  been applied to `/checkout`, twice, and to neither read in `CartContent`. A diner
  who reloaded or arrived from a bookmark got a full-screen dead-end hero on first
  paint.

  **Four things adversarial verification of the above turned up, all fixed here.**

  Two were regressions this change introduced. `isOvernight` compared the raw
  `"HH:MM"` strings while `parseClockTime` accepts `H:MM`, so the two disagreed
  about what a time is — in both directions. `"17:00" <= "9:00"` is
  lexicographically true, so a 9-to-5 bakery written `9:00` read as an overnight
  service and took orders at four in the morning; `"2:00" <= "18:00"` is false, so
  a food truck written `18:00 – 2:00` read as a window no minute is inside and
  could not sell at any hour of its own service. Both functions compare parsed
  minutes now, and an unreadable time closes the shop rather than waving an order
  through — the same call `storeStatus` makes next door, where forgetting hides a
  restaurant rather than letting one take orders it cannot honour. `isStoreOpen`
  also reported "open, no current service, opens again in two hours" when the two
  reading frames fell back differently on a timezone `Intl` rejects; it asks
  `isWithinBusinessHoursAt` about its own clock now. The rule is shared, the clock
  is each caller's.

  Two were consequences of selling stock for the first time. A cancelled order
  gave nothing back — a restaurant that cancelled three orders was left showing
  three portions it still had, with the dish possibly off the menu and a full tray
  behind the counter — so `updateStatus` returns what the order took, once, which
  `cancelled` being terminal is what makes safe. And the sale told the delivery
  platforms nothing: `stock.quantity` is what suspends an item on Uber Eats and
  builds the Deliveroo availability delta, the Inventaire screen has booked that
  push on every manual edit since the beginning, and there is no sweep to catch a
  missed one. Both apps' `products.ts` and `menus.ts` carried their own copy of
  `scheduleMenuSync`; it is one module now, and the order path is its third
  caller.

  One more, on the same path and the same shape: `/checkout/success` rendered
  `error.message` from the payment-verification actions straight onto the screen a
  diner sees _after_ being charged — `[CONVEX A(stripe:verifyCheckoutSession)]
Server Error`. `SettlementRejectedError` joins the family, so the sentence that
  says a payment does not settle this order arrives intact.

  Held by tests that stay: `openingHours.test.ts` and the cross-checked window
  cases in `product-service.test.ts` for the rules, `refusal.test.ts` (including a
  `convexToJson`/`jsonToConvex` round trip of every payload) and `stockPatch.test.ts`
  for the pieces, and `checkout-refusals.test.ts`, `order-opening-hours.test.ts`
  and `cart-hydration.test.ts` in both apps for the wiring — including the
  restock, the platform push, and the two malformed-hour outages above. Assertions that matched
  a thrown English message now match `data.code`: the copy is French and gets
  edited, the code is the contract.

- ab869a8: Let a paid order print itself, and stop the kitchen screen going dark

  Four defects met in the same place, and three of them had been closed once by
  deleting the thing that revealed them.

  **The kitchen cooked orders nobody had paid for.** `createWithTicket` inserted
  the order and its ticket in one transaction, before any provider redirect: a
  customer who reached Stripe and closed the tab left a slip on the pass, and
  nothing retracted it. The rule is now "a _paid_ order feeds the kitchen", and
  it lives in `releaseToKitchen` rather than in any one caller — every payment
  path reaches it through `orders.recordPaymentStatus` (Stripe webhook, Stripe
  success-page verify, PayPal capture, SumUp verify) or `markCashPaid`. It is
  idempotent, so a webhook racing its own success page still produces one ticket.

  **`orderConfirmation` is a promise the product can keep now.** It was withdrawn
  for offering a workflow nothing implemented. `releaseToKitchen` reads it:
  `"auto"` — and unset, which is every existing establishment — releases on
  payment; `"manual"` holds the order until staff accept it, which is what
  `orders.updateStatus` to `confirmed` now does.

  **Automatic printing was dead product-wide.** `stores.updatePrintConfig` had no
  caller in `packages/admin` or either app, so every establishment ran with
  `printConfig === undefined`, `kitchenTickets.create` stamped every slip
  `printStatus: "not_required"`, and `getPrintQueue` was permanently empty. The
  editor is back, in `packages/admin` this time, on the store-detail screen both
  apps already render. Beside it: the print reliability work — `claimForPrint`
  takes a ticket in one transaction so two tablets on the same pass cannot both
  print it; `getPrintQueue` returns failed slips again once their retry delay has
  passed, so `printAttempts` is finally read by something; and the trigger commits
  its render with `flushSync` and refuses to print a slip whose content is not
  there, because a blank page filed as "printed" leaves the queue and is never
  seen again.

  **The KDS query was unbounded and nothing was ever deleted.** `getByStore`
  subscribed to every ticket a store had ever had; `getByStatus` behind the
  "Terminées" tab did the same for the class that only grows. Both are bounded
  now — the live read to the three active statuses, the completed tab to a page at
  a time — and `purgeExpiredTickets` runs nightly, because bounding a read while
  the table grows for ever only moves the failure.

  **A customer's allergy reached the validator and stopped there.** The Uber Eats
  mapper extracts `special_instructions` and `customer_request.allergy` into
  `notes`; `createFromWebhook`'s item validator had no field for it and the
  webhook passed `notes: undefined` one line before the insert. Both carry it now,
  through one shared `toKitchenTicketItemsFromPlatform` rather than the same
  mapping hand-written in two byte-identical files.

  Two things the ticket never carried and the product depended on: `allergens`,
  gathered from the products ordered, which the printed slip has always had a
  block for and only demo data ever filled; and `estimatedPrepTime`, without which
  `estimatedReadyAt` was never set and the overdue alarm could not fire for a real
  order. Stations are routed as well — `stationMapping` sends a category to a
  pass, and an order is split into one ticket per station it touches, so the cold
  station is not handed a slip for a pizza.

  Breaking: `kitchenTickets.getByStatus` now takes `paginationOpts` and returns
  Convex's `PaginationResult` — `{ page, isDone, continueCursor }` — rather than
  an array, so a caller reads `result.page` and drives it with
  `usePaginatedQuery`. `printStatus` gains a `"printing"` literal, and
  `markPrintSent` / `markPrintFailed` take an optional `claimId`.

- 91d388a: Stop a product deletion from breaking Deliveroo and bricking the menu that used it

  `products.remove` was `handler: async (ctx, args) => { await ctx.db.delete(args.id) }`
  and nothing else, while thirteen columns across nine tables pointed at
  `products`. Two of them are REQUIRED — `externalProductMappings.internalProductId`
  and `favorites.productId` — so those rows survived holding an id that resolves to
  nothing and could not be repaired field by field. Measured before the fix:

  ```
  menu still holds the dead id: ["10002;products"]
  that product now resolves to: null
  favorites rows left: 1, externalProductMappings rows left: 1
  favorites[0].productId resolves to: null
  ```

  **Deliveroo was told a deleted dish had synced.** Proven end to end through the
  real signed webhook route, with only `globalThis.fetch` standing in for
  Deliveroo's servers:

  ```
  --- ordered dish was DELETED, its PLU was mapped ---
  [Sync Debug] Item PLUs: Tiramisu:PLU-TIRAMISU
  [Sync Debug] hasMissingPLU=false, hasMismatch=false
  sync_status body: {"status":"succeeded","occurred_at":"..."}
  ```

  `getByExternal` returned the surviving mapping without ever dereferencing
  `internalProductId`, so the webhook's PLU loop counted zero unmatched items and
  answered `sendSyncStatus(..., "succeeded")` for an order the kitchen cannot
  cook. **And the formule became permanently uneditable**: `menus.update`
  re-validates every stored section as a unit, so one dead id refused every
  subsequent write — including the one removing that section.

  **The decision is per referencing table, and it splits on authorship**, which is
  the reasoning `categories.remove` already established: a cascade destroys an
  afternoon's work on a click meant to tidy up.
  - **Refused** while they point at the dish — `menus`, `promotions`, `prizes`.
    Each is a selling decision the owner made, and each has a screen to unmake it
    on. The refusal names them: _Ce produit est utilisé dans 1 formule : "Formule
    Midi"._
  - **Cascaded** — `externalProductMappings` and `favorites` (machine-kept rows
    that mean nothing without the dish), `orphanProducts` (the platform match is
    void, so the import returns to `pending` for review), and the
    `linkedProductId` provenance link on twins in other establishments.
  - **Left alone** — `orders.items[].productId`. What was sold is history, the
    column is already optional, and rewriting it would falsify the receipt.

  `favorites` gained a `by_productId` index. Every index on that table started at
  `userId`, so reaching the customers who favourited one dish would have meant
  collecting the whole establishment's favourites inside a mutation that deletes a
  single row — the same reason `by_storeId` was added to it for the store cascade.

  The refusals are `ConvexError`, not plain `Error`: Convex redacts a plain
  error's message in production, so a carefully counted refusal would have reached
  the owner as "Server Error" and read as a bug in the product — the same
  reasoning `auth.ts`'s `denied()` records. The products table was throwing that
  sentence away too, showing a generic _Échec de la suppression du produit_; it
  now shows the reason, through a `convexErrorMessage` reader added to this
  package.

  **`getByExternal` dereferences the product**, and keeps doing so after the
  caller was fixed. `products.remove` can no longer create such a row, but a store
  cascade, a restore or a hand-run mutation all arrive at this same query, and "we
  have a mapping" must never outlive "we have the dish". `getByInternal` is
  deliberately left alone: it is keyed on a product id the caller already holds,
  so it cannot manufacture a match for a product nobody asked about.

  **Two more routes to the same `succeeded` were found by an adversarial pass and
  closed.** Both produce the identical customer-visible outcome, reached without
  deleting anything.

  The webhook accepted `pos_item_id` **or** `plu` **or** `external_reference_id`
  as a POS identifier when testing for "no identifier at all", but the check that
  looks the identifier up in our own mappings read `pos_item_id` alone. A line
  identified by either of the other two skipped the database check entirely. All
  four sites now resolve the identifier through one `posItemId()` helper, which
  uses `||` rather than `??` because an empty string is not an identifier — with
  `??` a line carrying `pos_item_id: ""` alongside a real `plu` stopped at the
  empty one and a dish we can cook was refused.

  And **the mapping lookup spanned the whole deployment.** A PLU is unique inside
  one restaurant, not across an account, so an order for one establishment whose
  PLU happened to be mapped in ANOTHER was answered as producible by a kitchen
  that has never heard of the dish. The same span made `.unique()` throw the
  moment two establishments shared a PLU string — which is exactly what a chain
  running one menu across its locations does — and the caller counts a throw as an
  unmatched item, so a correct multi-store deployment refused its own orders.
  `getByExternal` now takes the establishment and reads a new
  `by_store_platform_external` index. Both directions are pinned by tests that
  were confirmed to fail without the change: the cross-tenant line answered
  `succeeded`, and the shared-PLU chain answered `failed`.

  **The store-cascade guard now sees foreign keys by type, not by name.** It read
  `validator.fields.storeId` — the field literally called `storeId` — which is not
  the same question as "what points at `stores`". Measured over the compiled
  validators: 46 FK columns, 43 named `storeId`, three invisible. More to the
  point, so was the next column somebody would call `restaurantId`, which is the
  exact failure the guard exists to prevent. It now walks the serialised validator
  by type and reports every path reaching `v.id("stores")`, however nested and
  whatever it is called. Verified by injecting `restaurantId: v.optional(v.id("stores"))`
  into an existing table: the guard fails, where the name filter passed it
  silently.

  Walking `validator.json` rather than the live validator objects is not a
  preference — the two use different keys for the same thing (`type` vs `kind`),
  and reading `.type` off a live node yields `undefined` for every field: a walk
  that finds nothing and a test that passes.

  That walk immediately found a live orphan. **`blogAutoConfig.targetStoreIds` is
  now detached on store deletion**, by `detachStoreFromBlogAutoConfigs`. A config
  belonging to establishment A that fans articles out to establishment B kept B's
  dead id forever after B was deleted; only the config's own `storeId` was ever
  handled. Every reference the guard finds must now be resolved either by the row
  being swept or by a named entry in `DETACHED_STORE_REFERENCES` that says what
  handles it — so a dangling id cannot be parked there to quiet the test.
  `systemAuditLog.targetStoreId` is listed as dangling on purpose: the
  `store_deleted` entry points at the store that was just deleted, and resolving
  it would erase the record of the deletion.

  **Breaking: the `printerSettings` table and `printerSettingsTable` export are
  gone.** Ten required fields, zero readers and zero writers anywhere in the
  repository since it was declared — the only reference outside the schema was the
  delete cascade, removing rows nothing could ever create. Its own comment kept it
  on the grounds that the planned thermal path would need "roughly" these fields,
  but those fields are ESC/POS-shaped (`ipAddress`, `port`, `usbVendorId`,
  `type: network | usb | bluetooth`) and that path is explicitly ruled out: the
  thermal path when it comes is cloud printing, whose shape `stores.printConfig`
  already carries. Auto-print runs on `stores.printConfig` today. Nothing can have
  written a row, so nothing is lost. The documentation that described it — in
  `CLAUDE.md`, both package READMEs, `STRUCTURE.md`, `EXAMPLES.md`, the docs app
  and `IMPLEMENTATION_STEPS.md` — was corrected with it, including a `SUMMARY.md`
  line advertising a `printerSettings.ts` function module that never existed.

### Minor Changes

- bd7a656: Wire up dine-in table numbers, and make the four allergen surfaces agree

  Two product surfaces were designed, translated, and never connected.

  ## A dine-in order now carries the table it is served to

  "Sur place" was offered in the order-type selector and accepted by
  `orders.create`, and nothing anywhere carried a table number — zero occurrences
  in `tables/orders.ts`, `tables/kitchen.ts`, the storefront, the kitchen
  components or the order functions. The printed slip gave a cook the dish and
  the customer's name, so staff had a plate and nowhere to take it. One of the
  three advertised order types was unusable. The tell was `checkout.tableNumber`:
  shipped and translated into `fr`, `en` and `es`, and read by no code at all.

  `orders.tableNumber` and `kitchenTickets.tableNumber` are new
  `v.optional(v.string())` columns. `orders.create` accepts a table, normalises
  it, and `releaseToKitchen` copies it onto every ticket the order produces; the
  slip prints `TABLE <n>` at the same size as the order number, and the kitchen
  display card shows it beside the order number.

  It is a **label**, not a number — dining rooms use `A3` and `Terrasse 4` as
  readily as `12`, and parsing the field as an integer would reject half of them.

  It deliberately does **not** share a foreign key with `gameQRCodes.tableNumber`,
  which names the same real-world thing. There is no `tables` table, and adding
  one would make dine-in service depend on the gamification QR codes being
  configured — a restaurant can serve _sur place_ without ever running the wheel
  of fortune. The two share a representation instead:
  `@be-in-digital/core/dining` normalises and bounds a table label for both.

  Required at the storefront, optional on the server. Uber Eats and Deliveroo
  forward `dine_in` orders that carry no table of their own, and refusing those
  would lose the order outright. A table number on a `delivery` or `pickup` order
  is rejected, which catches the order whose type was switched after the table
  was typed.

  While wiring it, the checkout form turned out to carry its **own** two-option
  fulfilment toggle that knew nothing about the store's services: a cart set to
  `dine_in` showed "À emporter" selected, and one click silently rewrote the type
  to `pickup`. The customer sat at a table and the kitchen was told to bag the
  order. The toggle now offers the same three types the cart does, filtered by
  the same predicate the server validates against, and selects exactly.

  ## One allergen vocabulary instead of four

  The chain was broken at every link, and each surface had drifted because each
  carried its own idea of what an allergen was:
  - the printed kitchen ticket rendered `{allergens.join(", ")}` — whatever text
    was in the array is what a cook read before plating;
  - the admin product form had **no allergen control at all**, only a zod field
    and a `[]` default, so a restaurateur could not declare one through the
    normal product editor;
  - the only production writer was therefore the AI image-to-product flow, whose
    prompt is written in French, feeding an unvalidated comma-separated text box;
  - `uberEatsMenuSync` declared `allergens?: string[]` and never mapped it, so
    every dish synced to Uber Eats went out with no allergen declaration.

  For an EU food business under INCO 1169/2011 that is a regulatory surface.

  `@be-in-digital/core/allergens` is now the single source of truth: the
  fourteen Annex II allergens plus `shellfish` and the two dietary markers, the
  alias table that matches French and English spellings through accents,
  ligatures and punctuation, the localised labels, and the Uber Eats mapping.
  It is framework-free and exported as raw source, so the design system, both
  apps, the admin package and the Convex runtime can all consult it.

  The representation decision, made once and applied everywhere: **allergens stay
  free text** — refusing a name we do not know would push a real declaration off
  the menu — **but every surface resolves through this vocabulary, and a value it
  does not recognise is treated explicitly as unverified rather than passed off
  as checked.**

  So: the badge renders it as the owner typed it and announces it as the
  restaurant's own wording; the kitchen slip prints it under `MENTIONS À
VÉRIFIER :` rather than folded into the allergen line, because a cook has to
  treat it differently; the admin marks the chip `non vérifiée` and states the
  consequence; and Uber Eats is not sent it at all, since filing an unknown value
  as `OTHER` would show a diner a declaration that names nothing. Those are
  reported to the owner instead of dropped in silence.

  Dietary markers are no longer treated as allergens anywhere: `vegan` printed
  under `ALLERGÈNES :` told a cook it was one.

  `packages/admin` gains one allergen control, shared by the product form (a new
  `Allergènes` tab) and the AI review card, so the two cannot disagree again.

  ### Known limitation

  `UBER_EATS_ALLERGEN_TYPE` maps every canonical key to an Uber Eats enum member,
  but those spellings are **not verified against Uber's live menu schema** —
  `developer.uber.com` is unreachable from CI and Uber does not publish the enum
  outside the partner portal. The mapping is total and typed, so correcting it is
  a one-table change that every caller inherits. Confirm it during Uber Eats
  onboarding; see `tasks/uber-eats-go-live-runbook.md`.

- 91d388a: Give the dining-room screen a dismissal window the owner can set

  `stores.displayConfig` decides how long a finished order stays on the
  customer-facing screen in the dining room. `kitchenTickets.getForDisplay` has
  read it since that screen shipped — `autoDismissEnabled` decides whether a ready
  order is dropped at all, `autoDismissMinutes` how long it survives — and nothing
  wrote it. Measured:

  ```
  STORED  displayConfig -> {"autoDismissEnabled":false,"autoDismissMinutes":15}  ready count = 1
  DEFAULT displayConfig -> {"autoDismissEnabled":true,"autoDismissMinutes":15}   ready count = 0
  writers via db.patch|insert|replace : 0
  readers of store.displayConfig      : 3
  ```

  So every establishment ran on the query's own fallback: **an order the customer
  is still waiting for disappeared from the wall they are watching, fifteen
  minutes after the kitchen called it ready, with no setting anywhere to change
  it.**

  The mutation had been deleted, and the field filed under "legacy", on the claim
  that nothing read the stored value. Three places in the repository stated that
  claim — the schema comment, the `updateSoundConfig` docblock, and
  `kitchen-sound-config.test.ts`, which certified it as a test — and the reader had
  never gone away. All three are corrected. So are four more found alongside them:
  both package CHANGELOGs (annotated rather than rewritten, as this repository's
  convention has it), `kitchen-alerts.ts` and its test, which still said
  `soundConfig` had no editor after #243 gave it one, and the audit line in
  `tasks/sales-readiness-backlog.md` that the claim originally came from.

  `updateDisplayConfig` is restored on the `updateSoundConfig` model, the field is
  typed rather than `v.any()`, and the editor is a fifth **Écran de salle** card on
  the kitchen tab, placed last because that tab is ordered as a service runs
  through it and the dining-room screen is downstream of everything.

  **The mutation refuses a window it cannot honour.** `v.number()` accepts `NaN`,
  `Infinity`, zero and negatives, and `getForDisplay` turns whatever is stored into
  `readyAt > now - minutes * 60_000`: `NaN` makes every comparison false, zero and
  negatives keep only tickets that became ready in the future — each of them
  emptying the ready column, which is the failure this setting exists to prevent,
  reached from the other side. `Infinity` is the odd one out, measured rather than
  assumed: it stores and round-trips, and quietly becomes a second, undeclared way
  to say "never dismiss" when `autoDismissEnabled: false` is the declared one. All
  are refused rather than clamped — silently storing a number other than the one
  sent is how a setting comes to disagree with the screen it governs, and it would
  put a value nobody typed into the audit trail. The editor clamps its own input to
  the same range, and a test pins the two ranges together so they cannot drift.

- cde4410: One design system, and per-store theming that reaches a diner

  Two structural defects, resolved together because the first cannot work until
  the second is settled: theming has to drive one design system.

  **Per-store branding painted nothing.** The Design screen has always written
  `stores.branding` — colours, typography, logo — and nothing read the colours
  back. `--primary` had exactly one definition per app, the literal `24 95% 53%`
  in `app/globals.css`, so every establishment the engine has delivered shipped
  the same orange. `buildBrandingCss` turns the stored blob into design tokens
  and `StoreTheme` paints the storefront with them, following the same
  establishment the rest of the storefront follows. Colours are re-emitted from
  parsed numbers and font families rebuilt from an allowed character set, because
  `updateBranding` validates a type and a length, not grammar. The foreground on
  a brand colour is chosen by contrast ratio rather than fixed to white — white
  on `#ffeb3b` is 1.07:1, a button whose label cannot be read.

  **The design system was forked five ways.** `packages/ui` (50 components),
  `apps/reference/components/ui` (37), `apps/themes/components/ui` (37,
  byte-identical to reference), `packages/admin/src/ui` (9). Sixteen of the
  twenty-six shared names had drifted: a default Button was `h-10` in the package
  and `h-9` in the apps, with different focus rings, so one storefront rendered
  two button heights depending on the page. There is now one implementation, in
  `packages/ui`, on the newer shadcn generation, reached through one specifier.

  Breaking changes for `@be-in-digital/ui`:
  - `Input`, `Textarea` and `Checkbox` are bare primitives. The composed-field
    API (`label`, `error`, `description` props and a wrapping `div`) is gone —
    pair them with a `Label`, which is what every call site but two already did.
  - `Breadcrumb` is the composable seven-part set. The data-driven component that
    took `items` is gone, and with it the `BreadcrumbItem` _type_ — that name is
    now a component.
  - `Alert` keeps `warning` and `success` but loses its `title` prop and its
    automatic icon map; use `AlertTitle`, `AlertDescription` and your own icon.
  - `Button` sizes shift to the current generation (`default` 40px → 36px) and
    gain `xs`, `icon-xs`, `icon-lg`. `Card`, `Switch`, `Label`, `Badge`,
    `Skeleton`, `Table` and `Tooltip` change geometry with them.
  - `ButtonProps`, `InputProps` and the other per-component prop interfaces are
    no longer exported; the components are typed from `React.ComponentProps`.
  - The package is published as TypeScript source. `exports` points at `src`,
    there is no `dist`, and consumers must transpile it. This is what restores
    the `"use client"` boundaries the bundler was stripping.

  `@be-in-digital/admin` no longer carries its own copy of nine primitives, and
  re-exports the sidebar from `@be-in-digital/ui`.

  `@be-in-digital/convex-schema` gains a typed `StoreBranding` and
  `StoreDoc.branding`, which were implicitly `any`.

### Patch Changes

- 009af63: Restore the accents on French copy that the twin comparison could not see

  The accent guard compared `apps/reference` against `apps/themes`, so a word
  de-accented identically in both was invisible to it: "doit etre dans le futur",
  "n'est pas configure" and "l'import reel" all passed a green check. It now
  measures each string against a list of French spellings instead of against the
  other app, which does not care how many copies of a fault exist.

  That found 128 de-accented words across 40 files, all of them user-facing:
  "Article supprime", "Commande acceptee sur Uber Eats", "Publiee le",
  "La quantite doit etre positive", "Selectionnez au moins un element a migrer".
  Validator messages, kitchen tickets, the blog editor and the system pages are
  all affected, and the strings ship to every client.

  `createMigrationRequest`'s test asserted the misspelling (`/au moins un
element/`), so it has been rewritten to assert the corrected message.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 7ae8072: `convex` moves from a hard dependency to a peer dependency.

  **Breaking: consumers must declare `convex` themselves**, at `^1.44.0`. Every
  consumer already does — both apps and the boilerplate are on 1.44.0 — so nothing
  in the fleet has to change today. It is still a change to the contract, hence
  the major.

  Both packages ship raw TypeScript (`main: ./src/index.ts`, `files: ["src"]`, no
  build step), so the consumer's compiler reads their source, which imports
  `convex/server` and `convex/values`. That is the definition of a peer: the
  consumer supplies the copy, and there must be exactly one. As a hard dependency
  at an exact version it was the opposite — the package brought its own.

  Measured on the real tarball rather than argued, with a consumer on convex
  1.42.0:

  |                                                       | Result                                                                                                                                  |
  | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | **Before** — `dependencies: { convex: "1.44.0" }`     | installs quietly, **two copies**: the consumer's `convex@1.42.0` and a nested `@be-in-digital/convex-schema/node_modules/convex@1.44.0` |
  | **After** — `peerDependencies: { convex: "^1.44.0" }` | npm **refuses**: `npm error peer convex@"^1.44.0" from @be-in-digital/convex-schema@2.2.0`                                              |
  | **After**, consumer on 1.44.0                         | installs, exactly one copy                                                                                                              |

  Two copies of `convex/values` means two sets of validators, which is the same
  class of failure as the two React contexts that once crashed the admin — quieter,
  because there is no provider to notice the mismatch.

  One limit worth stating: inside this monorepo the change has no effect. Workspace
  links resolve `convex` from each package's own `devDependencies`, so
  `packages/convex-schema` keeps using its local copy whatever a sibling declares.
  The guard is real where the packages are installed from the registry, which is
  every client site.

### Minor Changes

- a561c61: One `convex` version across the monorepo: 1.44.0.

  Six manifests declared three different things — `1.31.7` exact in the engine,
  the template and three packages, `^1.34.0` floating in `apps/site`, and a
  `>=1.0.0` peer in `packages/admin`. pnpm installed **two copies**, and
  `apps/site` was the only workspace on the newer one.

  The 1.31.7 pin was not a compatibility constraint. It was an incident fix: the
  unconstrained peer in `packages/admin` let pnpm resolve `convex` to the highest
  version in the repo while the app provided context from the lower one, so
  `useQuery` found no provider and the admin crashed on render for every user.
  Pinning `convex` as an explicit devDependency of `packages/admin` out-voted the
  resolution. Declaring the same exact version everywhere removes it instead —
  there is no second copy left to pick.

  `convex-schema` and `convex-functions` carry `convex` as a real dependency, so
  consumers inherit this bump.

  Nothing in the 1.31.7 → 1.44.0 range is breaking: no removed runtime API, no
  change to `ctx.auth`, and the same `node >= 18` floor. Two consequences did
  need handling. Convex 1.35.0 flipped codegen for components from static
  expansion to a `ComponentApi` reference, which is why `_generated/api.d.ts` in
  the engine and the template loses ~1980 lines each; `components.betterAuth` is
  still exported under the same name, now typed by better-auth's own package. And
  `_generated/server.d.ts` gains a typed `env` for `CONVEX_CLOUD_URL` and
  `CONVEX_SITE_URL`. The new default was accepted rather than opted out of with
  `legacyComponentApi`.

  The remaining hazard is untouched and deliberate: `packages/admin` still peers
  on `convex: ">=1.0.0"`. A permissive peer is right for a library, and with every
  manifest agreeing it cannot mis-resolve — but it is what made the original
  incident possible, and it will again if the versions ever diverge.

- aa2880f: Four multi-store defects, all of them settings written by the dashboard and
  read by nobody — or data written and never cleaned up.

  **Deleting an establishment takes its data with it.** `stores.remove` deleted
  the store row alone. Forty-two `storeId` columns across twenty tables were left
  pointing at a document that no longer existed, and the id stayed in
  `userProfiles.storeIds`. Nothing complained: `v.id("stores")` validates how an
  id is encoded, not that it resolves. The sweep is batched and resumable — one
  mutation is one transaction, and an established restaurant has more orders than
  a transaction may touch — so `remove` clears one batch and the app wrapper
  schedules `purgeStoreData` until there is nothing left. `favorites` gained a
  `by_storeId` index: both of its compound indexes start with `userId`, so it was
  the one table that could not be swept by store.

  **"Horaires globaux" governs the storefront.** `useGlobalHours` was written by
  the dashboard and read by nothing — `use-store-status` took `store.hours`
  unconditionally, so an owner who edited the global week and left every location
  on the flag changed nothing a visitor could see. `resolveStoreHours` resolves it
  on read rather than copying on write, so editing the global hours reaches every
  location that follows them without a migration.

  **Opening hours are the restaurant's, not the visitor's.**
  `globalSettings.timezone` was written and never read: open/closed came from
  `now.getDay()` and `now.getHours()`, the browser's clock. A customer abroad got
  the wrong answer, and anyone could change it by changing their system clock.
  `isStoreOpen` and `getNextOpenTime` take an optional IANA zone; without one they
  behave exactly as before, and an unknown zone name falls back to the visitor's
  clock rather than throwing.

  **Saving the Integrations tab keeps the Uber Direct credentials.** The settings
  form read `globalSettings.get` — the public storefront query, which strips
  `customerId`, `clientId` and `clientSecret` — so the fields came up empty and
  saving patched the empty values over the stored ones. It reads `getAdmin` now,
  the query behind the same `settings:read` the Paramètres page already requires.
  `upsert` also merges `integrations` platform by platform, so a tab saving its
  own section no longer takes out the others; each platform is still replaced
  whole, so disconnecting one remains possible.

  The three integration switches gained an id and an `aria-label`. They had
  neither, so a screen reader announced three anonymous check boxes.

- 629e88e: An order is refused when the restaurant is not taking any, and when it is not
  the kind the restaurant runs.

  **"Fermé" and "Indisponible" now mean it.** `orders.create` checked
  `isPublishedStore` alone, and both statuses are _published_ — that is what keeps
  a paused restaurant listed with a readable menu. The storefront greyed out every
  button on them and nothing else did, so a tab left open, a cart restored from
  localStorage or a direct call took the order anyway. `isOrderableStore` is the
  narrower rule, next to `isPublishedStore` where the wider one already lived.

  This reverses a decision the suite documented — _"a closed restaurant is
  published: it takes orders for later, and the storefront is what decides whether
  to offer that."_ It does not hold: `closed` and `temporarily_unavailable` are set
  by hand from the dashboard, and the two screens that offer ordering already
  refuse on them. Pre-orders for a named later date are a feature nobody has built;
  until someone does, the status means what the owner meant.

  **The four service switches are enforced.** `globalSettings.services` was written
  by the settings page and read nowhere that mattered. The storefront took
  `store.overrides.services` — `undefined` on every establishment that has not
  customised it — and the selector read `undefined` as "offer everything", so a
  restaurant that does not deliver still showed Livraison. `orders.create` never
  looked at `args.type` at all.

  `resolveStoreServices` puts the store override first, the global switches next,
  and everything-on last, so a deployment whose settings row has never been saved
  keeps working. `ORDER_TYPE_SERVICE` is the one map the selector filters on and
  the mutation validates against — the button a customer can press and the order
  the server accepts can no longer disagree. `clickAndCollect` is deliberately
  unmapped: three order types, four switches, and folding it into `takeaway` would
  make that switch mean two things.

- 74de4e9: `orderConfirmation` and `displayConfig` are gone; `soundConfig` stays.

  The audit listed three store settings as dead — "mutations and audit entries
  wired, with no reader or writer". Two of the three were, and the reason they
  looked wired is worth recording: the only screens that wrote them lived in
  `apps/themes/components/admin/settings/`, a folder no route renders. Both apps
  route `/dashboard/settings` and `/dashboard/stores/[id]` to `@be-in-digital/admin`,
  so those six components had been orphaned and left behind. The folder is deleted.

  `orderConfirmation` was the worse of the two. `"manual"` promised that staff
  would validate an order before the kitchen saw it, and nothing implemented it:
  `createWithTicket` sends every order straight through. A setting nobody reads is
  dead code; a setting that promises a workflow the product does not have is a
  false promise to the restaurant owner. It is withdrawn rather than left offered.

  The two fields stay declared in the schema, optional, alongside `branding` and
  the other legacy columns — a stored field absent from the schema fails
  validation on the next write to that document, so removing them outright would
  break the establishments that already hold one. Nothing writes them now.

  `soundConfig` is **not** dead and is kept: `KitchenContent` hands it to
  `KitchenSoundManager` in both apps, on the routed kitchen display, and it decides
  which alerts sound and how loudly. Deleting it would have silenced a working
  feature. It has no editor — the KDS runs on the component's fallbacks — which is
  a gap worth closing and not the same thing.

  > **Correction, 5 Sep 2026 (Q-2).** The entry above is left as written, because
  > it is the record of what was decided; this note is the record of what was
  > wrong with it. `displayConfig` did have a reader, and had one at the time:

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 285b579: Record establishment changes in the system audit log

  `systemAuditLog` was only ever written by system operations, so a restaurant
  could be created, renamed, moved, reconfigured or deleted and the journal stayed
  empty. Every mutation in the stores module now appends an entry naming the
  actor, the establishment, the operation, the timestamp and the before/after of
  the fields the edit moved.
  - `systemAuditLog` gains `store_created` / `store_updated` / `store_deleted`,
    an optional `targetStoreId`, and an index to read one establishment's history.
  - The printer API key is redacted on both sides of a `printConfig` diff, and
    create/delete snapshots use a field allowlist so the legacy `integrations`
    blob never reaches the log.
  - `system.getAuditLog` scopes establishment entries to the stores the reader has
    access to, and pages with Convex's own cursor instead of arithmetic that
    stalled after the second page.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 5eec48d: Maintenance & migration system: a per-deployment maintenance contract (derived status, update coverage keyed on release date), a release catalog synced from npm that locks published versions once the contract expires, site migration requests (controlled-transition workflow plus audit log), self-serve renewal through Stripe (the `bidProduct: maintenance` webhook creates a contract, never ownerEntitlements), and SES notifications when a request is opened. Adds a Maintenance tab to the admin System page.
- 83f6af9: Enforce the order status machine in `updateStatus`.

  The mutation wrote whatever status it was handed. Nothing stopped an order going from `pending` straight to `completed`, or a cancelled order being revived — the transition table existed but only the storefront services consulted it, as advice.

  Three layers each carried their own opinion and they had drifted. The admin UI offered "Envoyer en livraison" on a ready order while the services table forbade `ready -> out_for_delivery`. The table is now single and lives in `@be-in-digital/convex-schema` (`ORDER_STATUS_TRANSITIONS`, `canTransitionOrderStatus`, `getNextOrderStatuses`); the services and the mutation both read it, and `ready -> out_for_delivery` is allowed, matching the button that already existed.

  **Behaviour change:** `updateStatus` now throws `Invalid order status transition: <from> -> <to>` instead of writing. Replaying the current status is an idempotent no-op rather than an error, so webhook retries and double-clicked buttons stay harmless. `updateFromWebhook` is deliberately left unguarded — Uber Eats and Deliveroo are authoritative for the orders they own.

  The cancellation window stops at `confirmed`, matching what Deliveroo permits: an order already being prepared, ready, or with a rider can no longer be cancelled internally.

## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 7f0122b: Republished from main. Fixes two problems with the 2.0.1 tarballs that broke consumers:
  - `@be-in-digital/core`: the `./auth/rbac` subpath pointed at `src/auth/rbac.ts` while the tarball only ships `dist/` → broken import for consumers (`convex-functions/auth` included). `files` now includes `src`.
  - The type fixes that were on main but never published (promotion-form/email-config in admin, Uber Eats signatures in integrations/convex-functions) go out with this patch — they had been committed without a changeset.

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 321adad: Production-readiness audit fixes for delivery integrations:
  - **integrations**: the Uber Eats order mapper now keeps money in integer **cents**
    instead of dividing by 100. Previously Uber order totals were stored 100× too
    small while Deliveroo and website orders used cents. `UnifiedOrder` money fields
    are documented as cents.
  - **convex-schema**: add the `oauthStates` table (single-use CSRF `state` for OAuth
    connect flows) and add `uberEatsConnections` to the package's composed reference
    schema so it no longer drifts from the app schema.
  - **convex-functions**: `createFromWebhook` now returns `{ orderId, created }` so
    webhook handlers can skip duplicate kitchen-ticket creation and double
    auto-accept when Uber/Deliveroo retry a delivery (idempotent order import).
